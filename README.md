====

Win32 / OpenGL clone of a TI-83 calculator game I used to play.  Keep the car between the lines.

Build and Running
====

This project requires MinGW to build and run. Once MinGW is setup, simply run `make` in the root folder of the project. This will produce the executable file in the same folder.

Known Issues
====

On some computers, the frame rate is not properly calculated and the game runs too fast.
