# Carz

![Carz Screen Shot](https://raw.github.com/DeadHeadRussell/website/master/Servers/data/images/personalProjects/Carz.png)

Win32 / OpenGL clone of a TI-83 calculator game I used to play.  Keep the car between the lines.

## Build and Running

Dependencies:
* Windows (W32 API)
* MinGW

Building
```bash
cd <project_folder>
make
```

This will produce the executable file in the root of the project folder.

## Known Issues

On some computers, the frame rate is not properly calculated and the game runs too fast.
